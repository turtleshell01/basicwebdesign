<h2> Welcome to my site!</h2>
<p> My name is Alaina Smith. I am 19 years old and I am majoring in graphic design. Some of my hobbies include illustrating and playing video games. I mostly illustrate traditionally but I also like digital drawing too. The video games that I play are usually anything Nintendo or occasionally something like Final Fantasy VII. I also love to scrapbook and I usually keep stuff like tags for items and concert wristbands. When I illustrate, it's mostly fan-art because I'm a nerd. </p>
