            <h2> What is Animal Crossing? </h2>
            <p> Animal Crossing is a series of games developed and published by Nintendo. In the games, as a human character, you develop your own town while also forming bonds with the animals living there. There are also other activities you can do such as shopping, fishing, digging for fossils, and bug catching. For most of the games you are acting as a citizen of the town, except for New Leaf. The time in the game also goes by real-life time. This game is great for those who just want a game where you can wind down and feel comfortable. The objectives are mostly the player's personal objectives and there is room for creative freedom, especially in the later games. </p>

            <p>  The first Animal Crossing game was released in 2001 in Japan as Dobutsu no Mori (lit. "Animal Forest")for the GameCube. It was released worldwide the following three years. Although there are no main objectives, you can attend fishing tournaments (as in later games) and fitness classes, as well as real-life holidays celebrated in the game. You will also develop your own house, and this is also going to be in the other games. As said previously, there are no main objectives but rather personal objectives the player might make. This includes developing your house, making enough money by selling things for bells, and invite friends over for multiplayer. You can save your game by approaching the gyro by your house. But be aware of not saving, as Resetti will scold you for it! </p>
